# mechVL
This repository contains the code developed within the [VMAP project](https://itea4.org/project/vmap.html) by [Soheil Solhjoo](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.solhjoo/) at the University of Groningen (UG). The project got the [ITEA award of excellence 2021](https://www.rug.nl/research/enteg/news/itea-award-of-excellence-2021-for-vmap-project?lang=en).

The codes serve as a virtual lab for performing mechanical tests on sheet metals via two separate modules (for uniaxial and multiaxial tests) using a CP-based material model called [DAMASK](https://damask-multiphysics.org/). (**Note: DAMASK v2 was used in this project.**) The virtual lab is written in MATLAB to perform as a pre- and post-processing tool for the internal spectral solver of DAMASK. The code has been tested on a Linux machine. The accompanying report describes the details of the virtual lab.

**UPDATE:** A [newer version of mechVL using DAMASK v3](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/mechVL/tree/455401aa2cf315f5144ee852ee019f810d7e0cc7/mechVL%20(DAMASK%20v3)) has been developed in 2021. In this new version, the [function for rotating the geometry of the RVE](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/mechVL/blob/efd1d736dbf9c97de378f5b535dbe5de25c8b50e/mechVL%20(DAMASK%20v3)/vl_general.py#L204C1-L251C40) in [vl_general.py](https://github.com/soheilsolhjoo/mechVL/blob/efd1d736dbf9c97de378f5b535dbe5de25c8b50e/mechVL%20(DAMASK%20v3)/vl_general.py) has been written by Kegu Lu at UG.
