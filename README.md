# VMAP_VL
This repository contains the code developed within the [VMAP project](https://itea4.org/project/vmap.html) by Soheil Solhjoo at RUG.

The codes serve as a virtual lab for performing mechanical tests on sheet metals via two separate modules (for uniaxial and multiaxial tests) using a CP-based material model called [DAMASK](https://damask-multiphysics.org/). (**Note: DAMASK v2 was used in this project.**) The virtual lab is written in MATLAB to perform as a pre- and post-processing tool for the internal spectral solver of DAMASK. The code has been tested on a Linux machine. The accompanied report describes the details of the virtual lab.
